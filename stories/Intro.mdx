# Welcome to san-webkit

[san-webkit](https://github.com/santiment/san-webkit/) is the fastest way to build new Santiment web
application.

## Requirements

Following tools should be pre-installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= v16.18.0 – JavaScript runtime environment
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) >= v8.x – package manager

## Installation

[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is used as a package manager, since it's a more efficient alternative to [npm](https://pnpm.io/motivation).

Install project's dependencies using a following command:

```bash
pnpm i
```

## Starting Storybook

Once you've cloned a repository and installed dependencies, start a storybook (development) server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Environment Variables

A list of build-time environment variables, that are necessary for a library/application to function correctly:

- `process.browser` - Boolean flag, which is used to determine if the code is running in browser/server environment;
- `process.env.IS_DEV_MODE` - Boolean flag, which is set to `true` during local development;
- `process.env.IS_PROD_MODE` - Boolean flag, which is set to `true` when library/application was built;

- `process.env.MEDIA_PATH` - Path to the directory, where static files are located (e.g. styles, icons, illustrations);

- `process.env.BACKEND_URL` - URL of the used backend API server;
- `process.env.GQL_SERVER_URL` - GraphQL endpoint for the given backend API server;

- `process.env.IS_STAGE_BACKEND` - Boolean flag, which is set to `true`, when the stage API server is used;
- `process.env.IS_PROD_BACKEND` - Boolean flag, which is set to `true`, when the live/production API server is used.

These variables should be set in `config.define` structure in `vite.config.js` file.
