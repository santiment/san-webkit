  <p>
    Another way to gain Pro access to Sanbase is by providing liquidity for the SAN/ETH trading pair
    on Uniswap V2! As long as you provide 3000+ SAN to our Uniswap V2 pool (and the corresponding
    amount of ETH), you will receive FREE access to Sanbase Pro, including all our metrics, new
    templates, and daily market insights!
  </p>

  <p>
    You can add liquidity to the SAN&lt;-&gt;ETH pool here:

    >.

    As soon as you hold the LP tokens in your wallet and connect it to your account or log in with
    it, you will automatically receive a Pro subscription within one hour
